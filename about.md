Hi!

I\'m Alexis Lopez Zubieta a software developer graduated from the 
[University of Informatics Sciences](https://www.uci.cu) in Cuba. I love 
creating useful and awesome software and share it openly with the world.
I also love to discuss about software development and software engineering 
and to code using C/C++ and Python.


This is my personal blog. A place to share my thoughts and to gather 
feedback. Thanks for reading.
